Mental Health Prediction📌 Project OverviewThis project aims to develop a Self-Analysis Mental Health Model that predicts mental health conditions based on user responses. The goal is to provide insights into potential mental health issues using machine learning techniques and an interactive Flask-based web application.
🎯 ObjectivesPredict mental health conditions based on various factors like demographics, work environment, and personal history.
Develop an interactive API using Flask for seamless communication between the model and frontend.
Explore advanced AI techniques, including potential LLM-based enhancements.
Optimize model performance for reliable predictions.
Ensure deployment readiness for real-world use.
🛠️ Technologies UsedProgramming Language: Python

🏗️ Model DevelopmentExplored multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Feature selection to improve accuracy
Model evaluation using confusion matrix and classification reports
🌐 Backend Development (Flask API)Developed a Flask API to handle requests and provide predictions.
Routes implemented:
/predict → Accepts user input and returns model predictions.
/train → Triggers model training and updates the model.
Pickle serialization used to store and load the trained model.
🚀 Deployment PlanDeploy using Flask on a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, or GCP).
Ensure scalability and performance optimization.
📌 Future EnhancementsIntegration of LLMs for enhanced insights.
Improving model accuracy with deep learning techniques.
Expanding the dataset for better generalization.
Adding explainable AI (XAI) features to interpret predictions.
